lollalaldjklafkdja this is probably kind of a mess but hey it's how my brain is working through this!

retrieved some code today from w3 schools and modified it so that i could use it to make my character svg's and gif's draggable!! i'm probably going to
impliment it in to my portfolio website next. apart from that i now need to decide on what fun button/hover animations i want to use for my portfolio
nav bar!
